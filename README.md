Junior Developer Coding Task for Bigfoot Digital

Navigation uses the hover effect with some transitions using JavaScript.

Schedule Appointment button in the hero displays a modal once clicked, this would allow the user to log back into their accounts or sign up.

The website has been built using Bootstrap as requested and is design using the "col-md" method.

All elements of the webpage have been told to fade in I have written that using JavaScript.

Two carousels are on the webpage one is on the "AS SEEN ON" section the other is on the "WHY CHOOSE US" section.

On mobile and tablet devices, the navigation will condense down into a burger navigation.

Thank you.
